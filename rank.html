The Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry’s ‘India Ranking Report 2016’ has released the top universities, management, engineering and pharmacy colleges list. This 

first-of-its-kind indigenous ranking framework for higher education institutions is in response to global rankings in which Indian universities and colleges usually do 

not fare too well.<p><br>

The ‘India Rankings 2016’ were put together with the participation of 3,500 private and public institutions, which were ranked by National Bureau of Accreditation 

(NBA) based on five criteria — teaching and learning resources, graduation outcome, perception, outreach and inclusivity and research productivity. All institutions 

were judged based on self-disclosure of information.<p><br>

The IITs have occupied the top 10 best engineering colleges slot with IIT Madras placed at number one with a weighted score of 89.42, followed by IIT Bombay, IIT 

Kharagpur, IIT Delhi and IIT Kanpur with weighted score of 87.67, 83.91, 82.03 and 81.07, respectively.<p><br>
